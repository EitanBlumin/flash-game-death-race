# Death Race (Flash Clone)
Top-down death race clone game in flash

I've built this game back in 2006 as something stupid to pass my time.

I happen to have heard about the [classic "Death Race" game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_Race_(1976_video_game)) from 1976, and its interesting game mechanics inspired me to recreate it as a fun simple Flash game.

## Game Mechanics

You're driving a vehicle within an enclosed "arena" of sorts with rubbery boundaries.

"Gremlins" (humanoid figures) randomly spawn within the arena and wander around.

If you hit a "gremlin", after a while, its corpse will turn into a tombstone represented by a grey cross.

If your vehicle hits such a tombstone, it will explode and cause damage to your vehicle.
If you take too much damage, your vehicle will be destroyed and the game will end.

Every once in a while, a "special" white tombstone will be spawned instead of a grey one.
If you hit this tombstone, it will make your vehicle invincible for a very limited amount of time.
You should use this limited time to hit as many grey tombstones as you can, to "clear out" the level from danger.

### Controls

- Up Arrow - Forward
- Down Arrow - Reverse
- Left Arrow - Steer left
- Right Arrow - Steer right

### Spawning Gremlins

Here's a fun fact:

Originally, I programmed the game to spawn one single new gremlin after an existing gremlin is killed.

However, due to a yet unknown bug, sometimes more than one gremlin show up instead of just one.

This actually made the game more fun and interesting the more you played, and it's a game mechanic that I planned on implementing by myself. But some freaky bug took care of it for me before I got to it!

## Source Code

I deeply apologize, but I've lost the game's source file long ago.
So all we have left is this single executable version.

Have fun!
